            <p><span data-contrast="none">Unfortunately, I haven&rsquo;t progressed much since I last wrote here. There is so little information accessible. I don&rsquo;t have enough to work with, but with Milo gone, I also have no way of finding out more. He was spotted with a strange kid no one seems to know at a motel a few days ago. The stranger was identified as Castel Reyes, who disappeared the same day Milo did, which makes me wonder if this new character has something to do with the crimes. At first I thought that they might be the fake Quinn&rsquo;s latest persona, but they seem to be legitimate. Their mother was interviewed for articles, and she&rsquo;s put up missing person ads for them. But other than their appearance with Milo, I can&rsquo;t find anything to connect them to the other cases. I don&rsquo;t know how Milo knows them, or if there is a connection at all. I wonder if the Milo spotted at that motel is the real one at all; perhaps he was already killed, and the fake Quinn is using his image to lure Castel in.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="none">Aside from that, all I have to work with relates to the Extremitas. I&rsquo;ve been researching their specific beliefs and ideas. I believe my summary in the last entry was quite accurate but lacked the evidence they use to support their beliefs. One of them is the curious case of Mendax&rsquo;s death.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="none">The God of mischief and illusion fell twice. Once, he was exiled from the stars, condemned to live on Earth among mortals. He was taken in by the Ahmed family, who were the loudest advocates for his return among the divine. Eventually, the Gods conceded, and Mendax rewarded the Ahmeds for their faith in him: by solidifying some of his blood, he created the first amulet and gifted it to them. The Curse of Darkening wasn&rsquo;t placed upon it until after his second fall, his death; no one had thought that such a thing would be necessary until then.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="none">No one knows what exactly happened to Menda<u>x</u>. It&rsquo;s said that when he died, the sky seemed to split, and the Creator&rsquo;s tears started to fall as rain so strong that countless lands flooded. The Ahmeds reached out to my ancestors, as my family has always had a special connection to divinity, and begged them to communicate with the Gods and find out what happened to him. We, servants of the people as well as the divine, obliged and did all </span><span data-contrast="none">s</span><span data-contrast="none">he could, but Gods refused to provide the information they wanted. To this day, we have no idea who killed Mendax or to what end. All we were told is that the killer stole the amulet of illusion shortly beforehand, and the stone was shattered into a million pieces during the battle. The Gods only managed to retrieve and return one shard; the rest has been lost to time. They casted the Curse of Darkening on what remained of the amulet and all the others that had been gifted to families in hopes of preventing history from repeating itself, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough for the Ahmeds. They turned their backs on the Gods that betrayed them; the rest of the world moved on.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="none">The Immortalist branch of Extremitas see this as evidence that Infernis was not killed when he fell, and that the Gods have been lying. They say that the reason the Gods are so secretive surrounding Mendax&rsquo;s death is because they don&rsquo;t want to confess that Infernis survived and is beginning to enact his revenge on divinity, and since Mendax has never been a very popular God among the people thanks to his trickery, they can easily get away with it. Sure, Gods have been known to fight among each other sometimes, but then, why such secrecy? And how could a human kill a major God like Mendax? This is what the Immortalists say. I&rsquo;m not sure what to think. Why would the Gods lie to us, especially since they are biologically designed to protect and care for humanity? How would such a lie benefit humanity? If anything, it would be a detriment to us. I have a hard time believing that Infernis is still out there, but perhaps &ldquo;Quinn&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t facing such struggles.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="none">I will continue to search. There must be something here that can explain all that has happened.
