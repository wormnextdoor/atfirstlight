            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Good evening, Jeremiah. Have a seat.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;I didn&rsquo;t do anything.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Relax. You&rsquo;re not in trouble. I just wanted to ask you a couple questions.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;What&rsquo;s this about?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Do you know River Ahmed?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;No. No, I&rsquo;ve got no clue who that is.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Really? I&rsquo;ve been told that you do.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Well, I don&rsquo;t.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Does this ring a bell?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;...Oh, her? Yeah, I met her once. Forgot her name, though. What&rsquo;d you say it was?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;River Ahmed. She got involved in a fight you were in, correct?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Yeah.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Tell me more about that.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;I was walking home after hanging out with my friends and stopped by my old primary school for a drink from the water fountain. Then, as I was leaving, I bumped into this kid I knew in, like, sixth grade. He started cussing me out and then things escalated into a fight. So, he was beating me up cause I didn&rsquo;t come to fight, I came for water, until this chick showed up and d</span><u><span data-contrast="auto">r</span></u><span data-contrast="auto">agged him off me. She threatened him with a knife. That scared him off. But I was all beaten up and bruised, so she took me to her house, and her mom helped me out. So, yeah, she was cool.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;This other person involved, do you know his name?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Yeah. Castel... uh... I dunno his last name. Something Spanish-sounding.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Castel Reyes?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Yeah, yeah, him.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;I see. Can you tell me what Castel&rsquo;s problem with you was?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Eh, it&rsquo;s real old. The man just never moves on. I broke his nose back in primary school, and he gave me a concussion. Got suspended for that. He did, I mean. I didn&rsquo;t get punished.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Do you recall how that fight initiated?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Sorta. He was real close with this other kid that I didn&rsquo;t really get along with, and got involved in stuff that didn&rsquo;t concern him. He was throwing all sorts of empty threats around; all bark and no bite, that guy. That&rsquo;s what I thought, anyway. So, I punched him, thinking it&rsquo;d scare him off, and the rest is history.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Another thing: did you know Florian Elster?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Yeah, that&rsquo;s the kid I mentioned.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Oh, really? Castel and Florian were close?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Mhm. They did everything together. You rarely saw one without the other.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;What was your feud with Florian about?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;I just didn&rsquo;t like ███ Apparenlty, it&rsquo;s a crime not to worship ███ the way everyone else did.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Hm, I see. Thank you for time. That&rsquo;d be all for now.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;I&rsquo;m confused. What does Florian have to do with River?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;I&rsquo;m afraid River was murdered some time ago, and Castel disappeared not long after.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Oh ████.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Please, if you have any information regarding Castel&rsquo;s whereabouts or something else that may be helpful with River&rsquo;s case, don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Oh, yeah, for sure. Uh, good luck with the, um, investigation.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Thank you. Good night, Jeremiah.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;&lsquo;Night, officer.</span></p>
