            <p style="text-indent: 5mm;"><span data-contrast="auto">BY DET. LEBLANC:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720}">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Thank you for coming, Joan. Please, have a seat.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Can you tell me about your relationship with River?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Oh, yeah, of course. We started dating I think... last year? Yeah, last December. We first met that same year at school. We didn't really get along at first because of this big misunderstanding, but eventually we cleared it up and... yeah. She was kind and thoughtful and supportive... everything I ever could&rsquo;ve asked for and more. I didn&rsquo;t deserve her.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Why do you say that?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;It&rsquo;s just that... I really struggle with social anxiety, which shouldn&rsquo;t have matched well with how outgoing and extroverted she was, but we made it work mostly because of her efforts. She never judged me or pushed me too far. </span><u><span data-contrast="auto">W</span></u><span data-contrast="auto">e went to a few big social events together, and if she saw that I was overwhelmed or anxious or just not having a good time, she always made up an excuse to leave, even if she wanted to stay longer. I could tell&mdash;she was a horrible liar. And now, recently, when she needed support... I couldn&rsquo;t be that for her.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;What was troubling her?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Our mutual friend, Florian, committed suicide recently. She had a lot of trouble accepting that. Not like, struggling to accept that they&rsquo;re dead, but... She was convinced that they were murdered.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Did she mention why?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;She insisted that the story wasn&rsquo;t adding up. It made perfect sense to me, so I figured she was just grieving in her own way. But then she started looking into it, and that got me really worried about her. I just... don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a normal and healthy reaction to loss, y&rsquo;know? So, I tried to get her to drop it. She said she would, but then she didn&rsquo;t, and we had this fight over the phone... then, out of nowhere, she texted me an apology. I replied, but she never saw it. And then, next thing I know, her parents are calling me asking if I&rsquo;ve seen her.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;At what time did you receive the message?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;It was nighttime. I think... around 7 or 8?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;What did it say?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Just something along the lines of &ldquo;You were right, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; I can show you if you&rsquo;d like. The timestamp should be on there, too.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Please.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Here.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;...Thank you.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Do you know anything about a fight River was involved in a few weeks before her disappearance?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;She got in a fight? I had no idea. Oh, God, I&rsquo;m so... I&rsquo;m sorry.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;No worries. Do you know if she had any enemies?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;No, not that I know of.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;What about her friends? Anyone she might&rsquo;ve been hanging out with the day she disappeared?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;She had a lot of friends. Florian, Rowan... Oh! The day she went missing, in the morning we fought on call, and she mentioned that she was going to see her friend Quinn.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Quinn? Do you have a last name or a way we could contact her?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Sorry, I don&rsquo;t. But I know they were meeting at Jonathan-Wilson primary school.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Did she go there often?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;I guess. Only recently, though. She used to never stop by, but I think she and Quinn always met up there, so she started going more often.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;She met Quinn recently?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Yeah. Not long after Florian&rsquo;s death.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;One last thing: you mentioned someone named Rowan. Do you have a last name or contact number?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Oh, yeah! I don&rsquo;t have his number or address or anything, but he shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard to find. River&rsquo;s parents will know where to find him; I think he was a family friend. But, um, his last name&rsquo;s Mitchell. Rowan Mitchell.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Perfect. Thank you for your time.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Of course.</span></p>
