            <p style="text-indent: 0cm; color: gray; font-size: small;"><span data-contrast="auto">Published Aug. 24, 2034, 7:30 a.m. &bull; By </span><u><span data-contrast="auto">Y</span></u><span data-contrast="auto">vonne Rochefort</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Ten years ago today, 16-year-old River Ahmed was found decapitated two days after having been reported missing. Now, her family continues to grieve as they hold a ceremony to honor her memory and raise awareness for unsolved cases similar to River&rsquo;s.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">&ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted us to spend all these years crying for her,&rdquo; said Joanne Ripley, who had been River&rsquo;s girlfriend. &ldquo;Justice was so important to her. She fought for equality and justice in every way she could. It&rsquo;s only right that now, we return the favor.&rdquo; And indeed, the Ahmeds worked hard to organize a ceremony at the warehouse where River&rsquo;s body was found, putting up pictures of River and others whose lives were lost and unavenged. Pictures of Castel Reyes and Rowan Mitchell, who were murdered shortly after River likely by the same person, were included, and victims&rsquo; families were all invited to attend.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">In the middle of all the photos, and right before the warehouse, incense was burned as Althea and Jacob Ahmed, River&rsquo;s parents, said a few words about their daughter&rsquo;s and all other victims honored at the ceremony&rsquo;s deaths. &ldquo;For as long as time continues to pass us by, we will continue to fight,&rdquo; said Jacob Ahmed during the ceremony. &ldquo;Hope can always be found, if you know where to look.&rdquo; However, the family declined to make a statement directly to us.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Even after all this time, police continue to hold out hope that the answers River&rsquo;s family is searching for are out there somewhere. They asked anyone with information on Milo Solis&rsquo; whereabouts to please reach out to them as soon as possible.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
