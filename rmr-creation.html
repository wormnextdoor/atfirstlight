            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Since I last wrote here, much has happened. River&rsquo;s body was found in some warehouse on along Cherrier, decapitated. Police found two different fingerprints on the murder weapon, an axe found stuck in one of the walls: River&rsquo;s, and ones belonging to Quinn Tremblay, a Canadian girl who moved to England in 2012 and died there five years later under mysterious circumstances. I did some research on Tremblay&rsquo;s death and tried to reach out to Milo in hopes of comparing Florian&rsquo;s, River&rsquo;s, and Quinn&rsquo;s cases, but I had the same problem River did and couldn&rsquo;t reach him. No one could. I did everything, but no one had heard from him since River&rsquo;s disappearance. At first, I assumed he was distraught and that in time, he might come around and respond to me, but then the worst happened: two days ago, Oliver MacMillan, his adoptive father, reported him missing. I didn&rsquo;t hear about it until now. His disappearance has been linked to River&rsquo;s death, and now everyone&rsquo;s worried that he&rsquo;ll be the next teen to turn up dead.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">I don&rsquo;t know what to make of it all. How is it possible that River worked with a dead girl for a month? Did anyone else see her? Is it possible that this was all the work of a ghost? But then, how would her fingerprints end up on the axe if she lacks a physical body? No, it couldn&rsquo;t have been a ghost. But then... it has to have been someone borrowing Quinn&rsquo;s name and appearance and perhaps even her body. When someone dies and the soul leaves a body, could a different soul possess it and keep it alive somehow? Could that have been what happened to Quinn? But why would that soul use its second chance at life to kill and collect amulets? Perhaps the soul is vengeful and wants to get back at the Gods for something. I don&rsquo;t know. I wish I could find out more. Maybe if I explain everything to Lorelei, she&rsquo;d be willing to provide more details on Florian&rsquo;s death... but I don&rsquo;t want her to get involved. She&rsquo;s not trained to deal with these things. I am. I must face it alone.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Regardless of the specifics, I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that Quinn isn&rsquo;t human. Therefore, I think it may be good to revisit what I know of divinity and magic to perhaps try to figure out what she is. And, of course, one must always start at the beginning.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">And before there can be a beginning, there must be an end.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="none">The New World&mdash;our world&mdash;was born from the ashes of the previous one. One day, the End will come, though even the Gods don&rsquo;t know how or when that will be, and our world will no longer be new. We, too, will become the dust tha</span><u><span data-contrast="none">t</span></u><span data-contrast="none"> will form another one. Thus is the cycle of life, an endless array of births and deaths. All of it was born from dust; over thousands of years, it came together to form a single being, only to split into two at the very last minute. Pulvis and Stelligeri, two halves of a whole. The remaining dust responded to Pulvis&rsquo; commands, building planets as if they were nothing more than paper airplanes. With a flick of her wrists, she created water. As she walked, she created trees and grass. When she took a deep breath, she created wind. With clay, she created a model; with dust, she brought it to life, and the world&rsquo;s first mortal being was born. When it got lonely, she gave it a friend. Then, they fell in love. They had children. Their children had children. Pulvis sat down and watched, a smile on her face.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="none">Pulvis was the beginning; Stelligeri was the end.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="none">God of death and destruction, she tore things down at her sister&rsquo;s request. When Pulvis made a mistake, Stelligeri was there. When the grass became dry and sad, Stelligeri put it to rest. When the creatures were so old that they could not even bring themselves to smile anymore, she took them by the hand and freed their souls from the clutches of their mortal bodies. They rested under the shade of a tree at first, but it quickly became much too crowded to be pleasant.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="none">&ldquo;Their end must not be unpleasant,&rdquo; she said.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="none">&ldquo;They should be happy,&rdquo; Pulvis agreed.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="none">&ldquo;I cannot build like you do,&rdquo; Stelligeri said. &ldquo;Please, sister, give them somewhere to stay. Let it be far from harm, high up in the sky. But let it be visible from the ground, so that the living may look up and remember them. That is all I will ask of you, sister. I can handle the rest.&rdquo;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="none">Pulvis nodded. And so, for her sister, she raised her arms high and filled the sky with shining lights: stars, each one a home for old souls to rest. Seeing this, the souls called her the Creator. Then, as Stelligeri guided them to their new homes, they dubbed her their guardian, the Soulkeeper.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="none">The Gods themselves told us all of this when, thousands of years ago, my ancestors asked. I have been given no reason to doubt the Gods&rsquo; truthfulness. I wonder if all of that will be put into question now.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
