            <p><span data-contrast="none">I&rsquo;ve been stuck for quite some time. I&rsquo;ve searched everywhere: family records, newspaper clippings and articles online, anywhere I could think of. For a month, nothing new has come up. Perhaps it was becoming an obsession; my family started to raise concerns about my behavior. I said I&rsquo;m fine, that it&rsquo;s a school research project that I&rsquo;m struggling with, and they advised me to be careful. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to end up like Isaac,&rdquo; my dad said. I asked who Isaac was.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="none">Turns out, it was the lead I was looking for. </span><span data-contrast="none">B</span><span data-contrast="none">ut let&rsquo;s start at the beginning.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="none">The job of the Custos begins with the death of Tempus, God of time. It occurred not long after Mendax&rsquo;s death, under equally mysterious circumstances. What we were told is this: after the fierce battle, the killer took the body, drained it of its blood, and secretly created an amulet, the amulet of time. Because of the secrecy surrounding its creation, it is not afflicted with the Curse of Darkening, like amulets before Mendax&rsquo;s second fall. One of my ancestors, Isaac, was sent to retrieve the stone and guard it. He became a prophet; the very first Custos. He wasn&rsquo;t told who the killer was or where to find the stone, but only a </span><u><span data-contrast="none">9</span></u><span data-contrast="none">eneral vicinity in which it should be hidden, and he was given the promise that the killer had already been taken care of. So, he left Ireland for Greece, and, after a decade of searching, retrieved the stone. Even a</span><span data-contrast="none">f</span><span data-contrast="none">ter completing his quest, he decided to stay in Greece, as he had already settled down there, and it&rsquo;s said that was his mistake: strange things began to occur, and he was driven to insanity.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="none">The Custos always keeps a notebook tracking dreams, prophecies, and the like&mdash;as I am doing now. This tradition started with Isaac; he had countless notebooks detailing his search for the amulet of time as well as the strange occurrences and his downward spiral. My father said that Isaac was forced to retire early because of his declining mental health, but continued to keep a notebook even then, because he still believed himself to be Custos. He was even kicked out of his home by his family, disowned and outcasted, because his daughter&mdash;his successor&mdash;spotted a drawing of the Vertical Eye in his notebook, which was, and still is, of course, blasphemous. After his death, allegedly a suicide, his final notebook was retrieved and has been kept as a reminder of the danger that comes with the job of the Custos. And yet, I hadn&rsquo;t been told this story until now.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="none">I believe that this may somehow be linked to the recent murders. So, for a week now, I&rsquo;ve been searching in secret for Isaac&rsquo;s old notebooks. It was difficult, as my extended family is visiting, including my five-year-old cousin and successor Kieran, so I&rsquo;ve barely had any time alone that I could use to search. But it shouldn&rsquo;t be much longer until they leave, which will give me more time to search. I have to find those notebooks. And I will. I swear, I will.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="none">&nbsp;I&rsquo;m getting closer to figuring out the truth. I have a feeling that this notebook will answer all of my questions, and everything will click into place, and those who have died will be brought to justice. I will retrieve all amulets that have been stolen. I will finish what River started.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
