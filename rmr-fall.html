            <p><span data-contrast="none">I have been given reason to believe that Extremitas might have something to do with River, Florian, and the real Quinn&rsquo;s deaths as well as Milo&rsquo;s disappearance. I&rsquo;m unsure which branch it is I&rsquo;m dealing with, but in the end, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter. What&rsquo;s important is that it&rsquo;s highly likely that those three murders and possibly more were more than just murders; they may have been sacrifices to the Fallen Hand.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="none">It&rsquo;s said that hundreds of thousands of years ago, back when there were no more than two Gods, the divine hands, and one became corrupted by hatred and greed, the other went down and killed him. The Creator couldn&rsquo;t bring herself to kill her own son, and the Soulkeeper couldn&rsquo;t leave the afterlife unsupervised, so Caelus herself descended and killed her brother to liberate humanity and prove that she will do anything for her people. But Caelus was her brother&rsquo;s opposite in every way: she was kind, so much so that many were shocked to hear that she would go so far as to kill her kin to protect humanity. For that reason, she was revered and greatly respected. But not all were convinced that she was capable of such a thing: those people hated her, called her a liar, accused her of pretending to have killed her brother for the glory. That is true for one branch, at least; the Immortalists. They sided with the Fallen Hand, stating that he was right to turn on Gods who perpetuate such lies, and eventually became a cult in Infernis&rsquo; name: the Extremitas.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="none">Resurrectionists are another thing, but ultimately, the result is the same. </span><u><span data-contrast="none">L</span></u><span data-contrast="none">oyalty to the Gods blind us to their lies, they say, and that once we realize the truth, it will be too late. They think they&rsquo;ll be spared from the End if they aid the Fallen Hand in his quest to regain power and enact revenge on the Gods. They think that he&rsquo;ll cast his hatred for humans aside and make them kings in the next world. It&rsquo;s absurd, but some people truly believe it. Or maybe they don&rsquo;t really believe it, but they&rsquo;re so scared of the End that they try it anyway, because they have nothing to lose. I pity them.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="none">The vertical eye is the mark of the Extremitas. When I spoke to the Ahemds, they said they were told that it had been drawn on River&rsquo;s forehead with her own blood. I also managed to find out more about Quinn&rsquo;s death, and the symbol was also observed on her corpse&rsquo;s forehead. As for Florian... I haven&rsquo;t been able to find out anything about the state of their body or if the symbol was present, but I think it&rsquo;s safe to assume that it was likely drawn on their forehead as well. A symbol representing the Gods&rsquo; caring watch over humanity, twisted to represent Infernis and his return, drawn on these corpses... perhaps &ldquo;Quinn&rdquo;, or whatever her real name is, believes that by harnessing the power of multiple amulets, she can revive Infernis or restore his power.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="none">If only I knew her true identity. She would be much easier to research and track down that way. But if that were known, then she&rsquo;d have been apprehended by police by now, and all this trouble would be spared. No, nothing comes easily. So, I will keep looking. I will do what River wanted to; I will avenge all who have fallen at this non-human's hands.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
