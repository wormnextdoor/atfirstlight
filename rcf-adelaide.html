            <p style="text-indent: 1cm;"><span data-contrast="auto">BY DET. LEBLANC:</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559731&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Adelaide. It&rsquo;s a pleasure to meet you. I&rsquo;m sorry for your loss.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Save it. Your sympathy won&rsquo;t bring my sister back.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;We&rsquo;re doing everything we can to bring her to justice.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Really? Because here you are, wasting time with small talk. Get to it.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Were you and River close?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Of course we were. She was my little sister. Even when I left for university, we used to call every weekend unless one of us was busy. I helped her with her homework from afar, and we&rsquo;d play video games on call. We were as close as siblings can be.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Did she mention any plans for the day she disappeared?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;No. She got super busy in the few weeks before her disappearance, so we didn&rsquo;t talk much. Last I heard from her, she was struggling to cope with her friend&rsquo;s death.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Florian Elster&rsquo;s suicide, correct?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Yeah. She was so sure that they&rsquo;d have told her if they were suicidal. I didn&rsquo;t try to reason with her because I knew she wouldn&rsquo;t listen. She was hard-headed like that; I loved her and hated her for it at the same time. So, I told her to do whatever she thought was right.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Do you know what she did?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;She started to investigate. She didn&rsquo;t tell me that, but I know that&rsquo;s what she did. She was so sure that they were mu</span><u><span data-contrast="auto">r</span></u><span data-contrast="auto">dered, and I figured that if she started investigating, she&rsquo;d realize that&rsquo;s not what happened, and it might give her closure. I don&rsquo;t know. I get wh</span><span data-contrast="auto">y</span><span data-contrast="auto"> she felt the way she did.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Tell me more about that.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;...Someone important to our family was murdered a long time ago, but the case was never closed, and we&rsquo;re all still hung up on it. She must&rsquo;ve been scared that history would repeat itself with Florian&rsquo;s death. Plus, because of her ADHD, she had a lot of trouble staying organized. Our parents thought she was immature and irresponsible for that. I never saw her that way, but I know a lot of other people did, too. I think she saw the investigation as a chance to prove herself to them, though she might not have realized that.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;I see. So, she had trouble with your parents?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;I wouldn&rsquo;t put it that way. They just underestimated her a lot. But otherwise, everything was fine. River had a great relationship with them, especially with our mom.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Do you know of anyone who might&rsquo;ve wanted to hurt her?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;If I did, I&rsquo;d have mentioned it by now. No, I can&rsquo;t think of anyone.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;She was openly gay, wasn&rsquo;t she?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Yeah, she was a lesbian.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Did anyone ever give her trouble for that?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Not really. I mean, kids at school said some stuff to her about it, but it never went far, and she didn&rsquo;t let it bother her. I highly doubt that her death was a hate crime.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Do you know anything about a fight she got into shortly before her death?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;A fight? What happened?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Your mother mentioned that she saw someone being attacked on the way home one day, and she intervened.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Oh. No, I don&rsquo;t know anything about that. It must&rsquo;ve happened after I last called her.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;When was that?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Uh... I&rsquo;m not sure. It should be saved in my call history, though.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Mind if I take a look?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Sure, whatever.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;...Perfect. Thank you, Adelaide. That&rsquo;s all.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;You better find whoever did this. Make them pay.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;I&rsquo;ll do my best.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;I don't want your best, I was results. Make. Them. Pay.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;That&rsquo;s enough, Adelaide. Good night.</span></p>
