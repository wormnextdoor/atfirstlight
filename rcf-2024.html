<p><span data-contrast="auto">After entering a warehouse on&nbsp;Cherrier road, &Icirc;le Bizard, to retrieve supplies, Thomas Gauthier discovered the headless body of 16-year-old River Ahmed inside.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The girl&rsquo;s parents had reported her missing on Saturday, which police say is likely when she died. She was last seen at her </span><u><span data-contrast="auto">p</span></u><span data-contrast="auto">arents&rsquo; house on Saturday morning before she left to visit her friend and never returned. The friend&rsquo;s identity has not been disclosed; her parents have said that she did not mention the person in question by name.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">According to police, it seems like River broke into the warehouse through the window and was then attacked and decapitated with an axe.
