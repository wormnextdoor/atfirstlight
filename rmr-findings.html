Bumps in the house, things moving seemingly on their own, and a constant sense of being watched. Even now, I can feel eyes on me, watching my every move.

            <p><span data-contrast="none">He tried to warn us, but no one listened. They called him crazy. His final notebook explains how he tried to kill her with a curse, a curse that should&rsquo;ve made her mind implode, but it all went wrong. Who knows what the curse really did, or if it did anything at all. He said that he would try to find out, but there are no more entries after that. It&rsquo;s said that he killed himself, but I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s what happened at all. She&rsquo;s a thousand times more dangerous than I thought. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s possible to kill her. A being incapable of dying is unheard of, I know, but if a fatal curse didn&rsquo;t work, then what will? Can anything be done? I have to warn people.
