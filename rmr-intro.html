<p><span data-contrast="auto">Yesterday, River Ahmed showed up at my house in a frenzy. One of the first words that came out of her mouth when I opened the door: &ldquo;Florian was murdered, and I think I might be next.&rdquo; The next thing I know, I find a note from her downstairs&mdash; &ldquo;Left to take care of something. Be back soon.&rdquo; But it&rsquo;s been a day, and she hasn&rsquo;t come back yet, and her family has reported her disappearance to the police. I plan on reaching out to the police soon, since I was the last person to have seen her, but I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t tell them everything. There&rsquo;s a reason River came to me and not to them; I&rsquo;ll respect her wishes and keep all this to myself, even if it stops the police from finding out the truth. Someone will know what happened to her, and that someone will be me.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">After I let her inside, she started telling me all about what&rsquo;s happened since the last time I saw her. That last time, she voiced concerns regarding Florian&rsquo;s sudden suicide and Milo Solis&rsquo; involvement. I&rsquo;ve been told that it was he who found their corpse, and according to River, he wasn&rsquo;t coping well with his discovery, despite not having been close to them at all. She planned on going to see him, and that was the last I heard of her until she appeared on my doorstep a few hours before disappearing. It was no secret that she suspected Florian&rsquo;s suicide to have actually been a murder. You could tell from the look on her face when she talked about it, and when I asked her, she didn&rsquo;t even try to deny it. That&rsquo;s nothing new; River&rsquo;s always been an open book, to the point where those who know her know not to spill their secrets to her. That&rsquo;s what makes her disappearance so odd. In her note, she said she&rsquo;d be back soon. So, why hasn&rsquo;t she returned? Where did she go?</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Something is wrong. I have a feeling she won&rsquo;t be coming back alive.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">What I know almost for sure is this: Florian was murdered, and the person who killed them, a girl who now goes by Quinn but Florian knew as Soren, is likely responsible for River&rsquo;s disappearance as well. Though the danger has made itself evident, I&rsquo;m going to finish what she started. It&rsquo;s my duty not only to her, but to divinity&mdash;if Quinn has River, then the power of the I amulets of time, illusion, and earth are at her mercy as well. As </span><u><span data-contrast="auto">C</span></u><span data-contrast="auto">ustos, I swore to ensure that such power doesn&rsquo;t fall into the wrong hands and have been trained to act if such a situation does arise. This is what a lifetime of preparation has been leading up to. If I stood by and did nothing, waiting for the cops to take care of it, I would be a disgrace to my family, my ancestors, and the Gods who entrusted me with this task. And it must be me alone; I can&rsquo;t put my family at risk. They don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m ready. If I told them about this, my father would try to take care of it for me. But he&rsquo;s retired. His duty has been passed on to me, and I will fulfill it. Just this once, I will do it in secret. After this, they&rsquo;ll see that I&rsquo;m ready, and it won&rsquo;t be necessary anymore. But just in case, I leave this all in writing, so that the one next in line may continue River&rsquo;s and my work.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I&rsquo;m going to do some research. Florian can&rsquo;t have been the first. There must be some kind of history, a connection I can make to past deaths or disappearances. I&rsquo;ll reach out to Milo&mdash;River said that she couldn&rsquo;t get in contact with him, but there must be a way. My family name has a certain weight, and we know a lot of people, so I&rsquo;m sure I can figure something out. But he must have valuable details regarding both Florian&rsquo;s death and River&rsquo;s disappearance; it&rsquo;s of upmost importance that I speak to him. From there, I can look into past cases and try to make connections. My ancestors&rsquo; journals may have information I can relate to this case. Quinn may not be the first to pull such a stunt; she may be finishing what someone else started generations ago.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">I don&rsquo;t know. But I&rsquo;ll find out. I swear it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559731&quot;:720,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
