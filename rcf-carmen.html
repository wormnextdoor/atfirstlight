            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Good morning, Mrs..</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;What happened? Is my son okay?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;I&rsquo;m sorry, we haven&rsquo;t found her yet. But we&rsquo;re searching.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Please, bring her home to me.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;We will. But right now, we need your help solving another case. Did Castel know a girl named River Ahmed?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Not to my knowledge.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;This is her. Have you seen her?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;...No. No, I&rsquo;ve never seen her before. Why?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;I&rsquo;ve been told that Castel knew her. Are you sure that she never mentioned a girl like her? Or perhaps a fight with her and Jeremiah?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;A fight? That can&rsquo;t be. Castel isn&rsquo;t violent.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Many have told me that River was involved in a fight between Castel and Jeremiah.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;I don&rsquo;t know anything about that. I&rsquo;m sorry.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Don&rsquo;t worry about it. Do you know if Castel knew Milo Sol&iacute;s?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Huh? Paloma and David&rsquo;s son?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;That&rsquo;s correct.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;No, Castel doesn&rsquo;t know him.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;So they didn&rsquo;t have any kind of relationship?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;No, of course not. Sol&iacute;s is of the high class, while we&rsquo;re barely getting by.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Do you think that could be why Castel ran away?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;I don&rsquo;t know. She worried a lot about our financial situation, but if that were the reason, I think she&rsquo;d have left sooner.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Were there other problems that could&rsquo;ve pushed her to run away?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Um... She and I didn&rsquo;t always get along. I love my son with all of my heart, but sometimes... she reminds me of my ex-husband. They don&rsquo;t look alike at all, but sometimes she says something, and her voice sounds like her father&rsquo;s to me. The truth is, I didn&rsquo;t want kids because I knew I couldn&rsquo;t be a good mother. But I got pregnant by accident, and Jos&eacute; wouldn&rsquo;t let me get an abortion. So, now I have a son, and I swear I love her, but it hurts. And because of me, she&rsquo;s hurting, too. I think she hates me for all the suffering I&rsquo;ve caused her. I think that&rsquo;s why she ran away. But oh, how I love her, officer. I can&rsquo;t live without her. Please, bring her back to me. I won&rsquo;t make her suffer anymore.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;We&rsquo;re doing everything we can to find her, Mrs..</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Please. I didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt her.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;I know, Mrs.. She must know it, too.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;No, I don&rsquo;t think she does. I want her to know.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Calm down. We&rsquo;ll find her, and you&rsquo;ll be able to tell her then.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;...I&rsquo;m sorry.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;It&rsquo;s okay. I understand that this is hard for you.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;It really is.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Get some rest. We&rsquo;ll finish this another day. Okay?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Yes. Yes, let&rsquo;s do that.</span></p>
