            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Lorelei Elster. Have a seat.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;I know what this is about. I promise you, my family had nothing to do with River&rsquo;s death.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Tell me about Florian.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;They were... a free spirit. They loved the world, even though they knew firsthand how cruel it could be.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Yet they left it behind.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;They had a lot of trouble at home, especially with their mother. A lot of it had to do with their identity&mdash;Gracie had a certain image of them that she forced them to fit, even though it wasn&rsquo;t who they were at all. There were a lot of other problems too, and it all piled up, and... They lost hope. Ran off one night and overdosed. We found them dead a week later.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;My condolences.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;It&rsquo;s fine. This isn&rsquo;t about them. About River&mdash;I spoke to her the morning she went missing.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Oh? Tell me about that.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;I called her. This Quinn person she was hanging out with claimed to have been a friend of Florian&rsquo;s, only they didn&rsquo;t know anyone named Quinn. I tried to warn her to stay away from the girl, but she wouldn&rsquo;t listen.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Do you know where I could find Quinn, or her full name?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;I&rsquo;m afraid not. But I can describe her for you.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Go ahead.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;<span class="NormalTextRun SCXW140704289 BCX8">She had wavy ginger hair reaching up to her shoulders, white </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW140704289 BCX8">skin</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW140704289 BCX8"> and a round face. </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW140704289 BCX8">I think her eyes</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW140704289 BCX8"> were... brown, maybe? Or hazel? I </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW140704289 BCX8">don&rsquo;t</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW140704289 BCX8"> recall. But she was about as tall as me</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW140704289 BCX8">, so</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW140704289 BCX8"> around </span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW140704289 BCX8">165 centimeters</span><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW140704289 BCX8">.</span></span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;...Great. Thank you. Now, tell me: were you aware that River was investigating Florian&rsquo;s death as a potential murder on her own terms?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Yes, I was. I knew she would before she even started from the look on her face at their funeral. She thought I was lying to her about their cause of death.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;And you allowed her to conduct the investigation?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;I did. I knew the truth, and I thought that soon enough, she&rsquo;d realize it, too. I know her family has always struggled with grief, so I understood where she was coming from and let her be. I didn&rsquo;t help her though, especially not after she tried to accuse me of murder.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Was Quinn involved?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;I think they were working together, yes. I don&rsquo;t know why Quinn was pretending to have been a friend of Florian&rsquo;s, though. Maybe she was just some random nosey teenager.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Do you know of anyone else that got involved in the investigation? Maybe people that River contacted or suspected of having killed Florian?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;She reached out to Florian&rsquo;s parents, and...</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;...that&rsquo;s all I know.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;A few weeks before her disappearance, River got involved in a fight. Do you know anything about that?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;A fight... </span><u><span data-contrast="auto">P</span></u><span data-contrast="auto">ossibly? I think I might know about that, yes.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;Do you know who was involved? Perhaps someone by the name of Jeremiah?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Jeremiah was involved?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;You know him?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;I&rsquo;ve heard of him. He used to bully Florian in primary school.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;I see. Do you know where I can find him?</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Sorry, I don&rsquo;t. But if it helps, I believe his full name is Jeremiah Lowley.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">Q.&emsp;That does help. Thank you. That&rsquo;s all for now. I&rsquo;ll let you know if anything else comes up.</span></p>
            <p><span data-contrast="auto">A.&emsp;Thank you.</span></p>
